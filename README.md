Mood Journal
============

> ## Summary
This mood journal is a documentation of your moods and/or emotions. After collecting a handful of entries, you can return back and read the different emotions you went through. During the process, you can discover new things you never understood about yourself. The dashboard feature will display the total mood's of the user and miscellaneous entry data.
